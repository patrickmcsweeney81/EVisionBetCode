## Overview

EV_ARB Bot scans sports betting odds across multiple bookmakers and identifies **expected value (EV) opportunities**. Using The Odds API, it fetches real-time odds, calculates fair prices from sharp bookmakers, and detects profitable betting edges for Australian and global bookmakers.

**Key Features:**

## Quick Start

# Option 1: Full Pipeline (Recommended)

```bash
# Stage 1: Extract raw odds (costs ~194 API credits)
python pipeline_v2/raw_odds_pure.py

# Stage 2: Calculate EV on extracted odds (no API calls)
python pipeline_v2/calculate_ev.py
```

# Output: `data/ev_opportunities.csv` with all EV opportunities

### Option 2: Legacy System

```bash
# All-in-one (legacy, costs ~1,000+ API credits)
python ev_arb_bot.py
# OR
launcher.bat
```

## Key Concepts


### Fair Price Calculation

Fair odds are computed as the **median** of sharp bookmakers:

**Sharp Sources (12 total):**
- Pinnacle
- DraftKings
- FanDuel
- BetMGM
- BetOnline
- Bovada
- LowVig
- MyBookie
- Betus
- Betfair AU
- Betfair EU

**Adjustment:**
- Betfair odds are reduced by commission (default 6%)
- Requires minimum 2 sharp sources for fair price validity


### Expected Value (EV)

EV% = (fair_odds / market_odds - 1) × 100

```text
EV% = (fair_odds / market_odds - 1) × 100
```
- **Positive EV** = Profitable bet
- **EV >= 1%** = Reported opportunity
- **EV < 1%** = Filtered out


### Player Props Grouping

Player props are isolated per player using a 5-tuple key:
(sport, event_id, market, point, player_name)

```text
(sport, event_id, market, point, player_name)
```

**ev_opportunities.csv** - EV opportunities above threshold
- Columns: sport, event_id, market, player, selection, sharp_book_count, best_book, odds_decimal, fair_odds, ev_percent, stake, [bookmaker columns]
- Sorted by EV% (highest first)

### Internal
- **seen_hits.json** - Deduplication hash storage (legacy system)
- **api_usage.json** - API quota tracking
- **cache_events.json** - Event caching

```text
  - Used by calculate_opportunities.py

### Outputs
- **ev_opportunities.csv** - EV opportunities above threshold
  - Columns: sport, event_id, market, player, selection, sharp_book_count, best_book, odds_decimal, fair_odds, ev_percent, stake, [bookmaker columns]
  - Sorted by EV% (highest first)

### Internal
- **seen_hits.json** - Deduplication hash storage (legacy system)
- **api_usage.json** - API quota tracking
- **cache_events.json** - Event caching

## File Cleanup (Dec 9, 2025)

The following temporary/debug files have been removed:
- ✅ `check_nhl_markets.py`
- ✅ `check_sports.py`
- ✅ `nba_outliers.py`
- ✅ `split_extreme_evs.py`
- ✅ `test_prop_api.py`
- ✅ `test_prop_response.py`

---

## Troubleshooting

### No EV Opportunities Found
- Ensure `.env` has valid `ODDS_API_KEY`
- Check `EV_MIN_EDGE` threshold (default 1%)
- Verify at least 2 sharp bookmakers have odds for each market

### 422 Errors on Props
- Some bookmakers don't support certain prop markets
- Pipeline handles gracefully—affected events are skipped for that market

### API Quota Exceeded
- Check `data/api_usage.json` for remaining credits
- Wait before next run, or upgrade API tier
- Pipeline V2 uses ~194 credits per run vs ~1,000 for legacy

---

## Development Notes

### Adding New Sports
1. Update `SPORTS` in `.env`
2. Define prop markets in `extract_odds.py` (e.g., `NCAAF_PROPS`)
3. Update `get_props_for_sport()` function
4. Pipeline automatically handles the rest

### Modifying Fair Price Calculation
Edit `calculate_opportunities.py`:
- `SHARP_COLS` - List of sharp bookmakers
- `fair_from_sharps()` - Fair odds logic
- Commission adjustments in Betfair handling
